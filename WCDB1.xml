            <Summary>
              Adam Lanza is believed to have shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, in the head at her home in Newtown, Connecticut, around 9 a.m. on December 14, 2012, before taking her car and driving approximately five miles to the Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he shot and killed 20 students between the ages of 5 and 10, as well as six adult workers. According to reports, most of the shooting occurred in two of the school's first-grade classrooms; 14 students in one classroom, and six in the other, were murdered. Only two of the victims who were shot by Lanza—both teachers—survived the attack. According to police, after firing between 50 to 100 shots, Lanza then turned the gun on himself, fatally shooting himself in the head as responders began arriving on scene, around 9:50 a.m.

            <li>On December 29th, 2011, Libya's National Oil Corporation announced that the country's output of crude oil was a little over 1 million barrels per day (bpd), compared to 1.6 million bpd before the uprising.</li>
            <li>At the beginning of the civil war, the UN Security Council froze an estimated $150 billion in foreign Libyan assets. By late November 2011, $18 billion had been released to the NTC by the council's sanctions committee. Meanwhile, demands for wages, medication and reconstruction were putting a strain on Libya's limited supply of cash, causing prices to rise. On December 10th, senior figures in Libya's new leadership wrote a letter to the United Nations, urging it to release the frozen assets which they said were "essential for the economic stability of Libya". On December 16th, the UN Security Council lifted sanctions on Libya's central bank and its offshore subsidiary, Libyan Foreign Bank. Later the same day, the U.S. Treasury Department said it had unblocked more than $30 billion in Libyan government assets. Western officials said legal complications prevented the money from being released quickly. A British Foreign Office minister said his administration would release Libyan assets frozen in the United Kingdom once Libyan authorities demonstrated their ability to manage them effectively.</li>

            <Summary>
                The 2011 Libyan civil war war an armed conflict in the North African state of Libya, fought between forces loyal to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and those seeking to oust his government. The war was preceded by protests in Benghazi beginning on Tuesday, 15 February 2011, which led to clashes with security forces that fired on the crowd. The protests escalated into a rebellion that spread across the country. This concluded with the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing an interim governing body, the National Transitional Council, which received diplomatic recognition as sole governing authority for Libya by 105 countries, the United Nations, European Union, Arab League, and African Union.

            <Summary>
                On January 16th, 2012, several insurgent groups began fighting a campaign against the Malian government for independence or greater autonomy for northern Mali, an area known as Azawad. The National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), an organization fighting to make Azawad an independent homeland for the Tuareg people, had taken control of the region by April 2012. On March 22nd, 2012, President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted in a coup d'état over his handling of the crisis. After the rebels took control and suspended the constitution of Mali, he government of Mali asked for foreign military help to re-take the north. On January 11th, 2013, the French military began operations against the Islamists while otherAfrican Union states were deployed shortly after. By February 8th, the Islamist-held territory had been re-taken by the Malian military, with help from the international coalition. Mali's government and the Tuareg rebel group, MNLA, signed a peace deal that called for Malian security forces and civilian officials to return to Kidal before a July 28 presidential election. It also called for the rebels to be disarmed. The July 28 election is meant to restore democracy in Mali.

            <li>25,000,000 deaths</li>
            <li>Genetic research indicates that HIV originated in west-central Africa during the early twentieth century. AIDS was first recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified in the early part of the decade. Since its discovery, AIDS has caused nearly 30 million deaths (as of 2009). As of 2010, approximately 34 million people are living with HIV globally. AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.</li>
            <li>HIV/AIDS has had a great impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has significant economic impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has also become subject to many controversies involving religion.</li>
            <li>AIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways, including ostracism, rejection, discrimination and avoidance of HIV infected people; compulsory HIV testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality; violence against HIV infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV and the quarantine of HIV infected individuals. Stigma-related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing treatment, possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV.</li>
        </HumanImpact>
        <EconomicImpact>
            <li>Economic research helps to estimate the effects of HIV/AIDS on the African economy and the cost effectiveness of prevention and treatment programmes</li>
            <li>Economic theory predicts that HIV/AIDS reduces labour supply and productivity, reduces exports, and increases imports</li>
            <li>The pandemic has already reduced average national economic growth rates by 2-4% a year across Africa</li>
            <li>Prevention and treatment programmes and economic measures such as targeted training in skills needed in key industries will limit the economic effects of HIV/AIDS</li>
            <li>HIV/AIDS affects the economics of both individuals and countries. The gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital. Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine, large numbers of people die from AIDS-related complications. They will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12 million AIDS orphans.</li>
            <li>By affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.</li>
            <li>At the household level, AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. A study in Côte d'Ivoire showed that households with an HIV/AIDS patient, spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households. This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.</li>
        </EconomicImpact>
        <ResourcesNeeded>
            <li>In many developing countries, high HIV rates are over-burdening already fragile health systems. As these health sectors struggle to provide basic health services, they must now also make HIV/AIDS prevention, services, and care available. To contain the spread and minimize the impact of HIV/AIDS, several global initiatives are making large amounts of financial and medical resources available. However, without efficient health systems, their impact will be limited.</li>
            <li>Consistent condom use reduces the risk of HIV transmission by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women.</li>
            <li>Circumcision in Sub-Saharan Africa "reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months". Based on these studies, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS both recommended male circumcision as a method of preventing female-to-male HIV transmission in 2007. Whether it protects against male-to-female transmission is disputed and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined. Some experts fear that a lower perception of vulnerability among circumcised men may cause more sexual risk-taking behavior, thus negating its preventive effects.</li>
        </ResourcesNeeded>
        <WaysToHelp>
            <li>The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, Federal Funding</li>
            <li>AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETC), Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI), Federal Testing Programs</li>
            <li>There is currently no cure or effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) which slows progression of the disease and as of 2010 more than 6.6 million people were taking them in low and middle income countries. Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections.</li>
            <li>Programs encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent HIV risk. Evidence for a benefit from peer education is equally poor. Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior. A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV. It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.</li>

            <li>An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. The highest reliable death count was estimated at 220,000. Haitian government estimates were higher.</li>
            <li>While the vast majority of casualties were Haitian civilians, the dead included aid workers, embassy staff, foreign tourists—and a number of public figures, including Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot, aid worker Zilda Arns and officials in the Haitian government, including opposition leader Michel "Micha" Gaillard. Also killed were a number of well-known Haitian musicians and sports figures, including thirty members of the Fédération Haïtienne de Football. At least 85 United Nations personnel working with MINUSTAH were killed, among them the Mission Chief, Hédi Annabi, his deputy, Luiz Carlos da Costa., and police commissioner Douglas Coates. Around 200 guests were killed in the collapse of the Hôtel Montana in Port-au-Prince.</li>

            <li>Hundreds of thousands of buildings plummeted to the ground including homes, the presidential palace, and even the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission.  The earthquake resulted in 105,000 homes being destroyed, causing $2.3 billion in damage and the nation being covered in rubble (Haiti).

            <li>Many countries responded to the appeals and launched fund-raising efforts, as well as sending search and rescue teams. The neighbouring Dominican Republic was the first country to give aid to Haiti, sending water, food and heavy-lifting machinery. The hospitals in the Dominican Republic were made available; a combined effort of the Airports Department (DA), together with the Dominican Naval Auxiliaries, the UN and other parties formed the Dominican-Haitian Aerial Support Bridge, making the main Dominican airports available for support operations to Haiti. The Dominican website FlyDominicanRepublic.com made available to the internet, daily updates on airport information and news from the operations center on the Dominican side. The Dominican emergency team assisted more than 2,000 injured people, while the Dominican Institute of Telecommunications (Indotel) helped with the restoration of some telephone services.The Dominican Red Cross coordinated early medical relief in conjunction with the International Red Cross.The government sent eight mobile medical units along with 36 doctors including orthopaedic specialists, traumatologists, anaesthetists, and surgeons. In addition, 39 trucks carrying canned food were dispatched, along with 10 mobile kitchens and 110 cooks capable of producing 100,000 meals per day.</li>

        <WaysToHelp>
            <li>From 12 January, the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has been working in Haiti since 1994, focused on bringing emergency assistance to victims of the catastrophe, in close cooperation with its partners within the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, particularly the Haitian Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</li>
            <li>Canadians were able to donate through the Humanitarian Coalition which distributed funds to partner organizations working in the field. During this time the Humanitarian Coalition raised over C$15 Million.</li>
            <li>The Netherlands sponsored a project, called Radio555. The Dutch radio channels 3FM, Radio 538 and Radio Veronica all broadcast under the name of Radio555, funded by a contribution of €80 million.</li>
            <li>Immediately following the earthquake, Real Medicine Foundation began providing medical staffing, in-kind medical supplies and strategic coordination to help meet the surging needs of the health crisis on the ground. Working in close partnership with other relief organizations, Real Medicine organized deployments of volunteer medical specialists to meet the needs of partner hospitals and clinics at the Haiti–Dominican Republic border and in Port-au-Prince, provided direct funding, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals to local health facilities and partner hospitals, provided advisory services and coordination to local health facilities, including physical therapy support, and coordinated mobile health outreaches, field clinics and food supplies to outlying villages overlooked in the relief effort.</li>

            <li>In the past 10 years, Tuesday's Children has provided emotional support to 3,000 children affected by terrorism.  We will never forget and VOICES of September 11 is part of the reason why. By providing information, support services and annual commemorative events for 9/11 families, rescue workers and survivors, the organization continues to commemorate the essence of that tragic day. VOICES also works to promote public policy reform on prevention, preparedness and response to terrorism. The organization named for fallen firefighter Michael Lynch, aims to empower children who lost relatives on September 11 by giving them educational grants to pursue higher education. In the last 10 years, the foundation has doled out 96 college scholarships, totaling more than $2.3 million (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/11/911-charities-how-you-can_n_957338.html).</li>

            <li>Several residents, including one former mayor, committed suicide after the spill.</li>
            <li>20 communities were in the oil's path where it caused major social and psychological impact like depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.This injury continues in places like Cordova today.</li>
            <li>Cleanup workers faced average oil mist exposure 12 times in excess of the regulatory limits, with a maximum exposure 400 times higher during hot water beach washing.  In 1989, 1,811 workers filed compensation claims, primarily for respiratory system damage, according to National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health</li></HumanImpact><EconomicImpact><li>According to several studies funded by the state of Alaska, the spill had both short-term and long-term economic effects. These included the loss of recreational sports, fisheries, reduced tourism, and an estimate of what economists call "existence value", which is the value to the public of a pristine Prince William Sound.</li>
            <li>The economy of the city of Cordova, Alaska was adversely affected after the spill damaged stocks of salmon and herring in the area.</li>
            <li>In 1991, following the collapse of the local marine population (particularly clams, herring, and seals) the Chugach Alaska Corporation, an Alaska Native Corporation, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It has since recovered</li>
        </EconomicImpact>
        <ResourcesNeeded>
            <li>There was use of a dispersant, a surfactant and solvent mixture. A private company applied dispersant on March 24 with a helicopter and dispersant bucket. Because there was not enough wave action to mix the dispersant with the oil in the water, the use of the dispersant was discontinued. One trial explosion was also conducted during the early stages of the spill to burn the oil, in a region of the spill isolated from the rest by another explosion.[clarification needed] The test was relatively successful, reducing 113,400 liters of oil to 1,134 liters of removable residue, but because of unfavorable weather no additional burning was attempted.Mechanical cleanup was started shortly afterwards using booms and skimmers, but the skimmers were not readily available during the first 24 hours following the spill, and thick oil and kelp tended to clog the equipment.Despite civilian insistence for a complete clean, only 10% of total oil was actually completely cleaned.</li>
        </ResourcesNeeded>
        <WaysToHelp>
            <li>In 1991, the Trustee Council was formed to restore Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska to the "healthy, productive, world-renowned ecosystem" that existed before the spill. In February 2012, funding commenced for the two long-term Programs: the Herring Research and Monitoring Program and the Long-Term Monitoring Program, also known as GulfWatch Alaska. The Programs are administrated under five-year contracts, which include annual Council and Public Advisory Committee meetings to review the past-year's results and future year's requested funding. The current Council contemplates the Programs to be twenty-years in length, concluding in 2032.</li>

        <History>
            <li>In 1887, a Denver woman, a priest, two ministers and a rabbi recognized the need for cooperative action to address their city’s welfare problems.</li>
            <li>Frances Wisebart Jacobs, the Rev. Myron W. Reed, Msgr. William J.O’Ryan, Dean H. Martyn Hart and Rabbi William S. Friedman put their heads together to plan the first united campaign for ten health and welfare agencies. They created an organization to serve as an agent to collect funds for local charities, as well as to coordinate relief services, counsel and refer clients to cooperating agencies, and make emergency assistance grants in cases which could not be referred.</li>
            <li>That year, Denver raised $21,700 and created a movement that would spread throughout the country to become the United Way. More than 125 years later, United Way is still focused on mobilizing the caring power of communities and making a difference in people’s lives.</li>

            <Summary>
                Immediately following the tragedy on December 14, 2012, The Sandy Hook School SupportFund (SHSSF) was created by United Way of Western Connecticut and the Newtown Savings Bank. The fund was established to receive undesignated financial donations, with the intent that the money raised would support families impacted by the tragedy, first responders, teachers, and the Newtown community in both the short and long-term. No fees or expenses have been taken for the administration of the SHSSF.

        <History>
            <li>Founded the morning after the disaster struck, SQR immediately began coordinating emergency relief aid to the affected area. In the first 6 to 8 months, SQR funnelled cash, services and material donations in excess of 15 million RMB to towns and villages in the quake zone – mainly tents, food, water, medical, hygiene and camping supplies, as well as several small-scale water and sanitation projects. SQR’s Winter Relief Project supplied warm bedding, clothing and camping gear worth more than 2 million RMB to more than 6,000 villagers.</li>
            <li>Acting as a logistics and information hub, SQR connected with other NGOs, donors and volunteers, as well as keeping media and wider communities updated on the latest situation. Recognising the repercussions for survivors and those who had suffered loss or injury, we linked dozens of international and local psychological experts with stricken communities.</li>
            <li>In summer 2008 SQR sent over 70 foreign and local teachers to coordinate and run Summer Camps in six temporary villages, delivering basic school equipment and educational supplies to more than 30 schools. This project was expanded in the summer of 2009 to become the Sports, Art, Music and English (SAME) Camps in 13 affected villages. More than 260 local and foreign volunteers taught about 4,000 children in the SAME Camps over a 7-week period.</li>
            <li>As the need for relief aid became less pressing, SQR began to look towards the long-term recovery and future development of the affected region. The badly-damaged Di Kang Le Kindergarten serving five villages in rural Guangji, Mianzhu County, was identified as in need of rebuilding. SQR entered into an agreement with the principal to not only rebuild the kindergarten, but vastly improve the community facilities in the area with a new community centre. The construction phase is complete and the community centre available for use by local community groups.</li>

            <li>On March 5th, 2011, the council issued a statement in which it declared itself to be the "sole representative of all Libya". Mustafa Abdul Jalil was named as chairman of the council.</li>
            <li>On March 10th, 2011, France became the first country to recognise the council as Libya's only legitimate government.</li>
            <li>In a ceremony on August 8th, 2012, the NTC formally transferred power to the General National Congress. Jalil stepped down as chairman, passing the position to the GNC's oldest member, Mohammed Ali Salim. The NTC was then dissolved, while the GNC members took their oath of office, led by Salim.</li>

            <Summary>
                The African Union played a big role in the coup d'état that overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré. Shortly after, the MNLA declared independence from Mali. However, the declaration was rejected as invalid by the African Union. On January 27th, the African Union held a summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Outgoing AU chairperson Thomas Boni Yayi, the president of Benin, told fellow leaders their response to conflict in Mali had been too slow, and thanked France, the country's former colonial ruler, for taking the lead in its military intervention there.

An act of the United States Congress appended the words "and Prevention" to the name effective October 27, 1992. However, Congress directed that the initialism CDC be retained because of its name recognition. CDC now operates under the Department of Health and Human Services umbrella.</li>

It was charged with the "classification of the public lands, and examination of the geological structure, mineral resources, and products of the national domain". This task was driven by the need to inventory the vast lands added to the United States by the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Mexican-American War in 1848. The legislation also provided that the Hayden, Powell, and Wheeler surveys be discontinued as of June 30, 1879.</li>
