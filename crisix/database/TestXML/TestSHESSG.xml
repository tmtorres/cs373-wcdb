            <Summary>
              Adam Lanza is believed to have shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, in the head at her home in Newtown, Connecticut, around 9 a.m. on December 14, 2012, before taking her car and driving approximately five miles to the Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he shot and killed 20 students between the ages of 5 and 10, as well as six adult workers. According to reports, most of the shooting occurred in two of the school's first-grade classrooms; 14 students in one classroom, and six in the other, were murdered. Only two of the victims who were shot by Lanza—both teachers—survived the attack. According to police, after firing between 50 to 100 shots, Lanza then turned the gun on himself, fatally shooting himself in the head as responders began arriving on scene, around 9:50 a.m.
